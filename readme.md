**Current problem on this project**

We tried to bring codes from Kaggle Challenge - to do data analysis and Image classification

However, there was no update on code while database and Tensorflow/Python version updated.

**Data Analysis/Classificaiton model progress**

After modifying some codes, we were able to run [Lung diseases data analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/code/sbernadac/lung-deseases-data-analysis) successfuly at our Google Colab page, [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13n6HGTUlo-q-4ZVlrBiS2sBBdkyYenY6?usp=sharing). Codes were fixed as the database and csv file changed a lot.

However, most of the model codes in Kaggle Challenge didn’t work - mostly due to TF version incompatibility, which sometimes combined with database renewal - drops error. For example, we tried to implement [Train Simple XRay CNN](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kmader/train-simple-xray-cnn), but failed as we can see at [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fin8r9jkJl-f1dSPcEmo60VCsPk540C0?usp=sharing). 

**Future plan**

For data analysis…

We will keep looking up for additional data analysis discussed in Kaggle page, run in our own Google Colab page and local computer, and make our original analysis and share our understanding

For Classification model…

Seek for github for many example codes of CNN, UNet, and many other machine learning model. Try to make code that works with our [NIH database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nih-chest-xrays/data). We are planning to finish everything in advance so that everyone can concentrate on final exams.
